	we will add possible start and end locations for ego and other adv vehicle here along with yaw angle
	Possible start locations for the ego and other vehicle are as follows:
	after the scenario there will be these intersection header with ego and other vehicle positions under them

	Intersection Leg1
		ego_vehicle x="-74.32" y="-50" z="0.5" yaw="270" model="vehicle.lincoln.mkz2017"
		other_actor x="-105" y="-136" z="0.5" yaw="0" model="vehicle.tesla.model3"

	Intersection Leg2
		egovehile x="-74.32" y="-50" z="0.5" yaw="0" model="vehicle.lincoln.mkz2017"
		other_actor x="-105" y="-136" z="0.5" yaw="0" model="vehicle.tesla.model3"

	Intersection Leg3
	egovehile x="-74.32 (add 5 more in -ve or +ve, whatever is req)" y="-50" z="0.5" yaw="90" model="vehicle.lincoln.mkz2017"

	Intersection Leg4
	egovehile x="-74.32 (add 5 more in -ve or +ve, whatever is req)" y="-50" z="0.5" yaw="180" model="vehicle.lincoln.mkz2017"
